# Dense-Matching-Disparity-Image-Challenge-Image-Processing

Required; Run a dense matching code you like that loads the above-given stereo image pair (left: im1.png and right: im2.png) and automatically finds the disparity image based on user-defined parameters.The quality of disparity you find is commonly measured in bad pixels (i.e. the percentage of pixels in the estimated disparity that are different from the ground truth). Thus, implement a function that counts those pixels in the estimated disparity that are different from the ground truth and returns a percentage of the different pixels in the whole image. You can consider a pixel wrong if its value is off by more than 1 disparity in either direction.Can you compute depth information from your disparity result? If this computation is possible, please comment on the method and additional information you require for such a depth computation.
